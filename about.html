            <h1>What do we do?</h1>
            <p>
                We work to conserve endangered species by breeding them in captivity, conducting research on their biology and behavior, and raising awareness about the threats they face in the wild. Our Zoo educate the public about animals and their habitats. They offer educational programs for all ages, from school field trips to family workshops. We encourage researches on animal behavior, nutrition, and diseases. These researches helps to improve the care of animals in zoos and in the wild. Furthermore, we work to rehabilitate injured or orphaned animals and prepare them for release back into the wild. Above all we work on to provide a fun and educational experience for visitors of all ages by offering a variety of attractions, such as animal shows, rides, and exhibits.
