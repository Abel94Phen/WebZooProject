                                Giraffes are the tallest land animals in the world, with males reaching heights of up to 18 feet and females reaching heights of up to 14 feet. They are native to the savannas and woodlands of Africa. Giraffes have a long neck and legs, a short body, and a spotted coat. Their long necks allow them to reach leaves and buds from tall trees, which is their main source of food. Giraffes are social animals and live in herds of up to 50 individuals. They are preyed upon by lions, leopards, and hyenas.
